# She-Codes-Hardware-Masterclass

Join Teej on a journey of hardware and microcontrollers.  We'll use the BBC Microbit to explore the world of hardware and work through a few simple projects together.  A computer is required and bring along a micro-USB cable (an android charging cable) if you have one.
